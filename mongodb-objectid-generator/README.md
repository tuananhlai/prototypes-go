# ObjectID Generator

The 12-byte ObjectId consists of:

- A 4-byte timestamp, representing the ObjectId's creation, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.
- A 5-byte random value generated once per client-side process. This random value is unique to the machine and process. If the process restarts or the primary node of the process changes, this value is re-generated.
- A 3-byte incrementing counter per client-side process, initialized to a random value. The counter resets when a process restarts.
